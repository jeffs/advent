# This problem really threw me for a loop, so I explored the space a little in
# Python.  It's great to use a dynamic language with a REPL to figure stuff out
# before investing in a more robust and maintainable implementation.  Python is
# especially nice for working with large integers.
#
# We're looking for a timestamp (in minutes) such that each bus arrives at a
# particular delay after that timestamp.  Each bus arrives regularly at
# multiples of some number of minutes, called the "bus ID," all starting at
# time zero.
#
# If we were to divide the target timestamp (once we found it) by each bus ID
# and take the remainder, we would have the complement of each delay: i.e., the
# number of minutes by which our timestamp missed the previous arrival of each
# bus.  It turns out that if we compute the remainders first (by subtracting
# each bus's delay from its period), we can then work backwards to find the
# timestamp using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
#
# Aside:  All the online materials I found about modulus arithmetic used
# conventions I found unfamiliar.  For example, instead of `f(x) % d = r` they
# would say `f(x) â‰¡ r (mod d)`, and they use 1-based indexes even when
# discussing remainders.  The only explanation I found accessible was this
# video from Randell Heyman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru7mWZJlRQg .
# Note, however, they he does not show how to find the _lowest_ solution, which
# is what we actually need for Advent.
#
# The theorem requires that all input divisors (in our case, the bus IDs) are
# coprime (i.e., don't share any prime factors).  This is true for all of the
# samples in the original problem statement, as well as for my input.  In fact,
# all the numbers "happen" to be prime, which is a pretty good hint we're going
# the right way.  Thanks, @topaz!
#
# It would be nice if we could consider the buses one at a time, then combine
# the results.  For example, if there were only one bus ID b having remainder
# r, we could find a timestamp t such that t % b = r.  (In that case, t = b + r
# would work.)  But how do we find a value t that works for all buses, instead
# of only one particular bus?
#
# If we were to find a suitable t, then add 0 to it, we would still have t.  In
# fact, we could add any multiple of b to t and still have a valid solution,
# because it would not change the value of t % b; in other words, (t + k * b) %
# b == t % b for any integer k, so if t is a solution, then so is t * k * b.
# (Remember that t being a "solution" for a given bus b means that b will
# arrive at t plus some delay, and our remainder r is the bus ID b minus that
# delay).
#
# So, we can define our target t as a series (sum) of per-bus solutions, as
# long as each per-bus solution is a multiple of all the other bus IDs.  This
# is the key insight that makes the Chinese Remainder Theorem work, and which I
# personally found a little hard to wrap my head around:  We're going to solve
# for each bus, but constrain each per-bus solution so that it can be added to
# all of the other per-bus solutions without invalidating them.  The sum of all
# these per-bus solutions will then, by definition, work for all of the buses,
# and be our final answer.
#
# The fact that our per-bus solutions have to be multiples of all the other bus
# IDs means the anwer will be a big number.  As the problem states:
#
#   With so many bus IDs in your list, surely the actual earliest timestamp
#   will be larger than 100000000000000!
#
# The size of that number (1e14) means we can't find the solution in time to
# earn a star on Advent by simply looping through all possible timestamps.
# Even if we check 1e9 timestamps per second (one every few clock cycles on a
# current generation CPU), it will take us over 24 hours to brute force the
# answer, which would be too long to complete this problem on the day it drops.
